The sky is rendered on a dome. The uv coordinates are generated in the sky-shader using world normals.
Sky dome uv coordinates:
float2 skyuv = ( float2( worldnormals.x, worldnormals.z ) / abs( worldnormals.y ) ) * 0.1;
The clouds areï»¿ created by multiplying two noise maps that each scroll at different speeds. The resulting blend is clamped at certain levels to create a 'cloud mask'. By adjusting the clamping values you can control the cloud density from clear sky to overcast.
